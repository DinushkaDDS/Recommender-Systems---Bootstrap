    "* For example:- when someone bought a pair of shoes we can recommend pair of socks to buy..!\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "* Association rules are considered as non-personalized recommendations as they do not consider each individual's behavioural pattern.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "* Rather than recommending top 10 recommendations (as in most popular based on context), association rules can help to identify items which are closely related based on majority of people behavior.\r\n",

    "2. Support: `(Number of times an item + an associated item occured)/ total number of times all the events occured`  ---->   `T(X AND Y)/T()`\r\n",
